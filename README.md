# Dropout-Regularization
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook exploring the use of dropout as a regularization technique in neural networks. The notebook demonstrates how dropout can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
Features
Explanation and implementation of dropout in neural networks.
Comparison of model performance with and without dropout.
Visualization of training and validation metrics to assess the impact of regularization.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
The objective of this notebook is to highlight the practical application of dropout in deep learning models and its effectiveness in reducing overfitting.
